  <h2>Real Usage Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I decided to share this tool because it genuinely improved my daily design process.
    Earlier, I used to install multiple font files just to test them,
    which slowed down my system over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I preview typefaces online, adjust text styles,
    export what I need, and apply it directly inside
    professional design software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach keeps my workspace clean and makes font selection much faster.
